# Project-06C-Dialog

# Implementation
I decided to make it have a strange fever dream aesthetic. This is shown in pretty much every part of the game.  
The weird dreamscape terrain was a lot of fun to make and add to the vibes as well as the weird textures I gave it. I thought it would be fun to give it the weird parts of materials. 
You can talk to 4 things. One of the stairs, Bob, the sphere, and one of the arches. Each has its own inky file. The conversations are all really weird to add to the vibes. 
I added weird music to set the mood.
I made the enemies move with ai but I didnâ€™t feel like they needed to do anything other than t-pose cause it makes it look weirder. You can also shoot the enemies with the gun that has a shooting animation. 
The score is being recorded at the top right of the screen. 
The objective is technically to kill the goblins but I think talking to the things is more fun.
